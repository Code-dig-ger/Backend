At CodeChef, we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a programming contest at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month.<\/p>\r\n<h4>About CodeChef April Long Challenge:<\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"last\">CodeChef Long Challenge is a 10-day monthly coding contest where you can show off your computer programming skills. The significance being - it gives you enough time to think about a problem, try different ways of attacking the problem, read the concepts etc. If you\u2019re usually slow at solving problems and have ample time at hand, this is ideal for you. We also put in a lot of efforts in getting quality problems, which would, in turn, foster your learning while solving them.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Contest Details:<\/h4>\r\n<ul class=\"last\">\r\n<li><b>Duration: <\/b>10 Days,\u00a0from 5<sup>th<\/sup> April 1500 hrs IST to 15<sup>th<\/sup> April 1500 hrs IST.

Also we believe that it is alright to refer to tutorials, books and other materials, learn a concept and then apply the same to solve a problem during a contest. But it is not alright to copy other people's solutions or seek other people's help to solve a problem without understanding it. The dividing line may seem to be thin but it can be captured by the spirit of learning. If whatever you are doing is making you learn while you do so, we tend to believe that it is alright. However, all the participants are expected to abide to <a class=\"button blue\" href=\"http:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/questions\/18662\/does-codechef-have-any-code-of-conduct\">CodeChef Code Of Conduct<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>Not just that, as a token of motivation we also give away cash prizes and goodies to the winners of the contest. However, our sole intention lies in making our users learn new concepts while competing.
